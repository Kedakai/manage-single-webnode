Sadly this Script seems like cancer.
It should work fine in it's current state.
But as you see from the number of commits in which period of time this Script will most likely never be finished.


# manage-single-webnode

!!! This Script is far away from finishing
Help does print wrong usage and some functions will not work or even damage
or delete things on your system. !!!


Script should be used for:

Setting up a Server's Software for Web-Based applications:
- php5
- nginx
- mysql (later mariadb)
- proftpd
- many other useful things

It will also give the option to setup the following software:
- logrotate (for nginx)

Manage virtual-hosts (with presets) and manage all hosts FTP-accounts from one virtual host.
It can also:
- add new nginx virtual host with SSL (Coming in v0.2)
- have the possibility to add premium costumer features
- setup an FTP-Manage interface (Written by a friend of mine)
- enableing/disableing costumers/groups
- delete costumers/groups
- add costumers (Groups are dynamic! We'll explain this in the docu)
- setup latest wordpress fully functional in 5 seconds (If mysql and nginx configured already)

Setting up proftpd with an sqlite3 Database and manage user_groups or single users.
This includes:
- Disableing/enabeling users/groups
- delete users/groups
- add users (groups are account with same root_domain)
