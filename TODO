Development for version 0.1 started

- Built into /usr/sbin/local and make setup more beatiful
- nginx_help does not contain delete or disable all
- Same as above for proftpd
- Built Feature to disable and enable FTP-Accounts without deleting them (Maybe table with (passbefore))
- nginx add with unlimited domainnames and ask for primary domainname after entered. (Maybe for loop until empty, we'll see..)
- Translate into german (set variable with language)
- Add a lot of comments
- Code beautifing
- Add verbose mode
- Search if it is necessary to look if anything for php5 is installed except of base php5 (Add support for other versions too.. difine php version in variable)
- Check for language...
- Make output more specific
- Make sed's more dynamic 
- Add force options
- Add support for mariadb (Maybe other db's too....)
- Add Support for more CMS'es
- Add Support for FTP-Manage Interface (Now the List is creeping me out...)
- Review FTP-Manage for security leaks. (This is quite important though....)
  Maybe we should look into a better version for this. Maybe docker. maybe not.
- Make FTP-Interface more beautiful (CSS and so one..)
- nginx should become an $reason disabled for domainname. (This will be funny tooo......)
- We need an reenable function for this too.
- Add function to delete single ftp-users (I really don't know if this is needed. Delete only admin user should not be necessary)
